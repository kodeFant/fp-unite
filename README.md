# fp-unite (working title)

fp-unite seeks to be a private support group for individuals in the functional programming space that are brave enough to serve others with software or content, be it open source or commercial.

**We have one requirement for joining: You are building something for the public with functional programming. It can be commercial, open source or a side-project.**

We encourage sharing your products, maker's journey, wins, failures, frustrations and questions.

Relevant members of this group can be consultants, freelancers, entrepreneurs, indie hackers, content creators, book writers and open source maintainers that use functional programming as their tool of choice.

If you aren't building something yet, you can join later when you have something brewing that you are willing to share :)

We think that people who share this set of common engineering values, can find a community together. An Elm developer might find it more desirable to work and socializie with peers in the Ocaml, Nix, Haskell, Scala or Lisp space than paradigms that might collide.

Functional programmers that uses traditional multi-paradigm languages should also feel equally welcome.

fp-unite seeks to empower functional programming to the mainstream so we can make it more relevant by creating jobs, high quality libraries and having a supportive tribe for sharing knowledge.

To keep the quality of the community high and motivating, we have a few guidelines that we will try to moderate as fairly as possible:

## 1. A safe space 

This circle exists to support, inspire and lift each other up. 

Let's keep polarization and heated debates to other circles. Take the high road and move on.

All representatives of etnicities, gender identities and minorities shall be treated with equal respect.

We encourage members of marginalized groups to engage as moderators/contributors or keep moderators accountable to ensure that open and unconscious biases aren't making others feeling left out in the cold.

We should also strive to give people who make unconcious mistakes the opportunity to correct themselves without being instantly frozen out or cancelled.

### Ask for consent before sharing publicly

We encourage spreading the word about the circle, but be careful about what content you screenshot publicly share that involve others.

Respect that other members might want to keep their content within the circle.

## 2. Start with the positives when offering feedback

If you have constructive feedback, we strongly encourage pointing out something you genuinely like with the product before offering advice.

Communication often fails on the internet, and actively displaying that you wish your peers well can be a good failsafe against unintentionally making someone feel bad.

Your experience and knowledge can be highly valuable to others. Stay humble, show empathy and don't weaponize your knowledge.

Don't discourage someone from making something you "know" will fail. Allow the less experienced and experimentalis the opportunity of a learning experience unless they explicitly seek to be roasted.

## 3. Introduce and promote yourself

We would love to hear about what you are working on. Please share a lot in the #shamelessplugs channel, new features, daily micro journals about your experiences etc.

Limit introducing your project to the #showcase channel only once to give everyone the chance for some visibility.

## 4. You are not entitled to other people's time or validation

Do not demand others to make time for you. Feel free to seek advice and share frustrations about your journey, but respect other people's time.

Don't put pressure on people who might have good reasons for prioritizing themselves, their families and businesses.
