# fp-unite (working title)

fp-unite is a private support group for individuals in the functional programming space that are brave enough to build software or content for the public, be it open source or commercial.

**We have one requirement for joining: You are building something for the public with functional programming. It can be commercial, open source, or a side-project.**

We encourage sharing your products, the maker's journey, wins, failures, frustrations, and questions.

Relevant members of this group can be consultants, freelancers, entrepreneurs, indie hackers, content creators, book writers, and open-source maintainers that use functional programming as their tool of choice.

If you aren't building something yet, you can join later when you have something brewing that you are willing to share :)

We think that people who share some common engineering values can find a community together. An Elm developer might find it more desirable to work and socialize with peers in the Ocaml, Nix, Haskell, Scala, or Lisp space than paradigms that might collide.

Functional programmers that use traditional multi-paradigm languages should also feel welcome.

fp-unite seeks to empower functional programming to the mainstream so we can make it more relevant by creating jobs, high-quality libraries, and having a supportive tribe for sharing knowledge and collaborating.

**To maintain a community of high quality, we have a few guidelines that we will moderate by:**

## 1. A safe space 

This circle exists to inspire and root for our like-minded peers. 

Let's keep polarization and heated debates to other circles. Take the high road and move on.

Representatives of different ethnicities, gender identities, and other minorities shall be treated with equal respect.

We encourage members of marginalized groups to engage as moderators/contributors or keep moderators accountable to ensure that open and unconscious biases aren't making others feel left out in the cold.

We should also strive, to a limited extent, to give people who make unconscious mistakes the opportunity to correct themselves without being instantly shunned.

### Ask for consent before sharing publicly

We encourage spreading the word about the circle, but be careful about what content you publicly share that involves others.

Respect that other members might want to keep their content within the circle. Ask for consent and respect the outcome.

## 2. Start with the positives when offering feedback

If you have constructive feedback, we strongly encourage pointing out something you genuinely like about the product before offering advice.

Communication often fails on the internet, and actively displaying that you wish your peers well is a good failsafe against unintentionally discouraging their journey.

Your experience and knowledge can be of invaluable help to others, but also be intimidating to newcomers. Stay humble, show empathy, and don't weaponize your knowledge.

Don't discourage someone from making something you "know" will fail. Allow less experienced builders, and experimentalists the opportunity of a learning experience unless they explicitly seek to be roasted.

## 3. Introduce and promote yourself

We love to hear about what you are working on. Please share a lot in the #shamelessplugs channel, like new features, daily micro journals about your experiences, etc.

Limit introducing your project to the #showcase channel to only a single post to give everyone equal chance for some visibility.

## 4. You are not entitled to other people's time or validation

Do not demand others to make time for you or validate you. Feel free to seek advice and share frustrations about your journey, but respect other people's time.

Don't put pressure on people who might have good reasons for prioritizing themselves, their families, and their businesses.
